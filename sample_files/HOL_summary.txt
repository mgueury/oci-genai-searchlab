Thank you for attending this workshop! Here's what you accomplished. You provisioned multiple services into a compartment in your OCI tenancy. These services included Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC), several AI services such as OCI Document Understanding, and Oracle Search with OpenSearch. You imported a project into OIC that ingests document files from Object Storage, sends them to different AI services based on the file type, and then loads extracted data into an OpenSearch index. You configured all of the service connections used by that OIC project and then you ran the integration project. Finally, you imported an application project into Visual Builder, you configured the connection to OpenSearch, and then you ran the project to display a search user interface. You used that search tool to query the content added to the OpenSearch index. This workshop has illustrated how different OCI services can be integrated together to use AI to make many types of content more searchable.
